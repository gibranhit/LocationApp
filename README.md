## Responsive UI Implementation

### Layout Strategy

The app uses **Jetpack Compose** with configuration-aware layouts:

```kotlin
val configuration = LocalConfiguration.current

if (configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
    Row(modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        // Left side - Cities list (weight = 1f)
        Column(modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)) { /* Search and list */ }
        
        // Right side - Map (weight = 1f)
        Box(modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)) { /* Interactive map */ }
    }
} else {
    // Portrait layout - traditional vertical stack
    Column(modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize()) { /* Full-width content */ }
}
```

### Landscape Mode Benefits

- **Improved Productivity**: View search results and map simultaneously
- **Better Context**: Immediate visual feedback when selecting cities
- **Space Efficiency**: Optimal use of wider screen real estate
- **Enhanced UX**: Reduced navigation between screens

## Search Implementation Strategy

### Core Search Algorithm

The search implementation uses a **hybrid approach** combining prefix matching with performance
optimizations:

```kotlin
// Primary search logic in SearchCitiesUseCase
private fun applyPrefixMatching(cities: List<City>, query: String): List<City> {
    return cities.filter { city ->
        val targetStrings = buildTargetStrings(city)
        targetStrings.any { target ->
            target.startsWith(query, ignoreCase = true)
        }
    }.sortedBy { it.name }
}
```

### Target String Generation

The search considers multiple string variations for each city:
- `"City Name, Country"` (e.g., "Alabama, US")
- `displayName` property
- `name` only (e.g., "Alabama")

This ensures comprehensive matching while maintaining strict prefix requirements.

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Prefix-Based Indexing
```kotlin
// In CitiesRepositoryImpl
private val prefixMap = mutableMapOf<String, MutableList<City>>()
private val PREFIX_LENGTH = 3
```

- Pre-builds index using first 3 characters of city names
- Reduces search space significantly for large datasets
- O(1) lookup time for prefix matching

#### 2. Chunked Processing
```kotlin
private const val CHUNK_SIZE = 1000

cachedCities.chunked(CHUNK_SIZE).forEach { chunk ->
    // Process cities in manageable chunks
}
```

- Prevents memory spikes during index building
- Better performance for large datasets (100K+ cities)

#### 3. Smart Caching Strategy
- **File-based caching**: JSON data cached locally for 7 days
- **Memory caching**: In-memory storage for fast access
- **Reactive caching**: Room database for favorites with Flow-based updates

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Reactive Programming with Kotlin Flow

**Decision**: Use Kotlin Flow throughout the data pipeline
**Rationale**:

- Enables real-time UI updates
- Automatic state synchronization between favorites and search results
- Memory efficient compared to LiveData for complex data transformations

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)
val cities: StateFlow<List<City>> = _uiState
    .map { state -> state.searchQuery to state.showOnlyFavorites }
    .distinctUntilChanged()
    .flatMapLatest { (searchQuery, showOnlyFavorites) ->
        // Reactive search implementation
    }
```

### 2. Multi-layered Caching

**Decision**: Implement three-tier caching system
**Rationale**:
- **Network**: Reduce API calls and improve offline capability
- **File System**: Persistent cache surviving app restarts
- **Memory**: Ultra-fast access for active searches

### 3. Prefix-only Search Strategy

**Decision**: Implement strict prefix matching instead of fuzzy search
**Rationale**:
- Meets specific requirements (e.g., "A" matches "Alabama" but not "Sydney")
- Better performance characteristics
- Predictable user experience
- Easier to optimize with indexing

### 4. Dependency Injection with Hilt

**Decision**: Use Dagger Hilt for dependency management
**Rationale**:
- Compile-time safety
- Better testing capabilities
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Android-optimized DI framework

### 5. Feature Modularization

**Decision**: Separate features into independent modules
**Rationale**:
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Parallel development capabilities
- Reduced build times through module isolation
- Clear feature boundaries and responsibilities

### 6. Responsive Design with Jetpack Compose

**Decision**: Implement adaptive layouts for different screen orientations
**Rationale**:

- **Enhanced UX**: Better use of available screen space
- **Modern UI Patterns**: Follows Material Design responsive guidelines
- **Development Efficiency**: Single codebase handles multiple layouts
- **Future-proof**: Easily adaptable to tablets and foldable devices

### 7. Shared Core Module

**Decision**: Create a dedicated core module for shared UI components and utilities
**Rationale**:

- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform UI/UX across all features
- **Reusability**: Reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead
- **Design System**: Centralized theme and spacing management
- **Testability**: Shared components can be unit tested independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new shared utilities
